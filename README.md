# lecture_mixed_models_AMU_2021

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the lecture given to doctoral students at Aix-Marseille University during the month of april 2021.

Feel free to share/comment/re-use.

In order to run the interactive .ipynb slides you should install the corresponding conda environment (I had to create a different environment for BRMS), see the environment.yml file and the instructions on https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

### Organization of the repository
The .ipynb are the source files of the lectures, the .html a static version of the notebooks and the slides.html the static version of the notebook but displayable as a slideshow. The .r files are the files shared to participants containing the R code (which they can run on the IDE of their choice). The .csv and .rds are data and pre-run model fits.
