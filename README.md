# lecture_mixed_models_AMU_2021

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the lecture given to doctoral students at Aix-Marseille University.

The HTML contains the non-interactive slides. In order to run the interactive .ipynb slides you should install the corresponding conda environment (I had to create a different environment for BRMS).
